**MVP Features for Uptime Monitoring Only**

1. **Uptime Monitoring**:
	* Monitor a website or a few key pages to check if they're up or down.
	* Record status (up/down) with timestamps.
2. **Basic Alerts**:
	* Send simple email notifications when the website goes down.
3. **Basic Dashboard**:
	* A simple frontend showing the status of monitored websites (up or down).
4. **Angular Frontend**:
	* Build a robust Angular application to display the uptime status.
	* Integrate with the.NET Core API for data retrieval.
5. **.NET Core API**:
	* Set up a basic.NET Core API to handle uptime checks.
	* Use Azure Functions to periodically check website status (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).
	* Implement logic to mark the site as up or down based on HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for up, 500 for down).
	* Store uptime results (status + timestamp) in Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB.

**MVP Timeline Breakdown**

#### 1. **Project Setup & Planning (1 week)**

* Define MVP features (just uptime monitoring).
* Set up the GitHub repo, project structure, and cloud services.
* Choose the basic technology stack (Azure for hosting and simple backend).
* **Estimated time**: **11 hours**

#### 2. **Backend Development - Uptime Monitoring (2 weeks)**

* Set up a basic.NET Core API to handle uptime checks.
* Use Azure Functions to periodically check website status (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).
* Implement logic to mark the site as up or down based on HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for up, 500 for down).
* Store uptime results (status + timestamp) in Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB.
* **Estimated time**: **22 hours** (2 weeks)

#### 3. **Frontend Development - Angular Dashboard (2 weeks)**

* Build a robust Angular application to display the uptime status.
* Integrate with the.NET Core API for data retrieval.
* Display a simple status (up/down) for the monitored site.
* Optionally, show timestamps of the last check.
* **Estimated time**: **22 hours** (2 weeks)

#### 4. **Basic Azure Integration & Hosting (1 week)**

* Deploy the backend to Azure App Services.
* Set up Azure Functions to run uptime checks on a schedule.
* Store uptime status in Azure SQL Database.
* Ensure the system can scale if more websites are added later.
* **Estimated time**: **11 hours** (1 week)

#### 5. **Testing & Debugging (1 week)**

* Test the uptime monitoring functionality: Ensure sites are correctly marked as up or down.
* Test email alerts for downtime.
* Ensure the backend, frontend, and cloud services work together.
* **Estimated time**: **11 hours** (1 week)

#### 6. **Deployment & Documentation (1 week)**

* Deploy the application to Azure and ensure it’s running properly.
* Write minimal documentation (e.g., how to add websites to monitor, how the service works).
* Create a README for the GitHub repository.
* **Estimated time**: **11 hours** (1 week)

**Total MVP Timeline Estimate:**

* **Total time**: **88 hours**
* **At 11 hours/week**: **8 weeks** (approximately 2 months)

**MVP Features Recap:**

* **Uptime Monitoring**: Check if websites are up or down at regular intervals (every 5-10 minutes).
* **Basic Email Alerts**: Send email notifications when the website is down.
* **Simple Dashboard**: Display the uptime status (up/down) on a simple dashboard.
* **Angular Frontend**: Build a robust Angular application to display the uptime status.
* **.NET Core API**: Set up a basic.NET Core API to handle uptime checks.

**Next Steps (Post-MVP):**

Once you’ve completed the MVP, you can begin expanding the project with more advanced features, such as:

* **Response time tracking**.
* **Alerting via SMS or Slack**.
* **Historical performance analysis**.
* **Trend graphs**.
* **User authentication** for managing multiple sites.

**Benefits of This Approach:**

* **Fast Deployment**: You’ll have a working version of the project up and running in about **8 weeks**.
* **Focused Scope**: By narrowing the scope to just uptime monitoring, you can ensure the MVP is functional and polished, increasing the chances of it making a strong impact on potential employers.
* **Scalable Foundation**: The project will still have a solid foundation that you can build on later.
